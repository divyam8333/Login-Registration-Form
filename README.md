# Login-Registration-Form

This project is a responsive login and registration form interface built using HTML and CSS. The login form, as shown in the image, features a sleek, modern design with a dark, futuristic background. It includes input fields for "Username" and "Password," along with options for "Remember me" and "Forgot Password?" links. The minimalistic styling is enhanced by icons inside the input fields, improving user experience and visual appeal.
